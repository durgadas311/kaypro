The BIOS consists of a Main Bios module, I/O module(s), and Support
modules.  Each module exists in .REL form on the distribution disk. They
are described below:

	MBIOS3KP.REL	Main BIOS module
	END.REL 	Termination for I/O modules
	LPTBL.REL	Logical-to-Physical drive translation table
	GETDP3KP.REL	Disk formats support routines
	SCB.REL 	System Control Block definitions

I/O modules:
	FDC3KP.REL	KAYPRO Floppy Disk Controller
	CRT.REL 	KAYPRO CRT controller
	KEYBD.REL	Keyboard interface and keypad conversion
	SERIAL.REL	Z80-SIO Serial ports (exc. keyboard)
	CENTR.REL	Parallel printer port

The LINK procedure is:

LINK BNKBIOS3=MBIOS3KP,FDC3KP,CRT,KEYBD,SERIAL,CENTR,END,LPTBL,GETDP3KP,SCB[B,OS,$SZ]

One important feature of the BIOS is that it supports many floppy
disk formats.  This is accomplished through the use of mode bytes
that define the specific paramters that determine the disk format.
The module GETDP3KP contains tables of mode bytes and standard DRI Disk
Parameter Blocks and a routine for selecting the appropriate mode and
DPB. The first two mode bytes select the media format.  The second two
mode bytes select drive and media type as follows:

  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
 "0"  -----------------------FORMAT----------------------------

  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
 SIZ DDS DDT DDD  STEPR  DQT MQT CNF MDS MDT MDD  --DSALG--  SEC

FORMAT	A bitmap indicating the requested media format. See GETDP3KP.ASM.
SIZ	Diskette size, 1=8inch, 0=5.25inch.
DDS	Drive Double Sided, 1=drive has two heads.
DDT	Drive Double Track, 1=drive is 96 tracks per inch (0=48tpi).
	Combined with DQT. Effectively don't-care if DQT is set.
DDD	Drive (controller) can do Double Density (MFM).
STEPR	Step Rate, dependant on drive size according to
	constraints of Western Digitals floppy controller chips.
DQT	Drive is quad-track (196 tpi, 160 tracks). This also implies
	special MOTOR control for speed switch. All non-QT media
	uses high speed mode.
MQT	Media is quad-track (196 tpi, 160 tracks)
TRK0F	Track Zero Format, bit-1 for side 1, bit-0 for side 0.
	1=different, 0=same as rest of disk.
	NOTE: side 0 uses SD 128 byte sectors,
	      side 1 uses DD 256 byte sectors.
CNF	Configure from disk, 1= track 0/side 0/sector 0 contains
	information on media format.
MDS	Media Double Sided, 1=DS.
MDT	Media Double Track, 1=DT. Combined with MQT. Effectively don't-care if MQT is set.
MDD	Media Double Density, 1=DD.
DSALG	Double Sided algorithm, if MDS=1 then these 3 bits define
	how to access the second side:
	 0  Wrap: do all tracks on side 0, then side 1 backwards.
	 1  Alternate: odd tracks are on side 1.
	 2  Alternate II: side 1 sectors are numbered SPT - 2*SPT-1.
	 3  Continue: Sectors >SPT are on side 1, same track.
	 4  Continue II: side 1 sectors are numbered SPT - 2*SPT-1.
	 5  (not defined)
	 6  (not defined)
	 7  (not defined)
SEC	Sector numbering offset, 0 = sectors start with 0,
				 1 = sectors start with 1.

The last 4 mode bytes form a mask, with "1" indicating bits that
cannot be altered by MODE.COM - these bits are also not used when
searching for a matching mode description.

For the winchester disk (logical drives), the first two mode bytes are
as follows:

  7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0   7   6   5   4   3   2   1   0
 "1"  .   .   .   .   .   -PTN-   ---CFG---   -LUN-   ---HEAD--

PTN	Partition, or logical drive, number.
CFG	WD1002 drive config bits, Kaypro 10 uses 101.
LUN	Drive LUN on WD1002. Kaypro 10 uses 01.
HEAD	Base head used for partition, Drive 0 = 000, Drive 1 = 010.

Note, the second mode byte forms a "template" for the data sent to the
WD1002 "SDH" register. The LSB is provided by the LSB of the track number.

Kaypro 10 uses a "vertical slice" partitioning scheme, where each platter
(pair of heads) represents a partition. Changing this scheme requires
a driver rewrite, but also would require a ROM rewrite to permit booting.
