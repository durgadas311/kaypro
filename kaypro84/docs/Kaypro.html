<H4>Basic Operation</H4>

<P>Floppy diskettes may be loaded/unloaded either using the "Disks" menu
or by clicking on the front panel area associated with the floppy drive.
When the mouse pointer passes over a floppy drive, it will become highlighted.

<P>To remove a floppy diskette (and leave the drive empty),
open the drive dialog (as describe in previous paragraph) and check the
"unmount" option and click the <B>CANCEL</B> button. Clicking the "Mount..."
button requires a file to be selected and will replace the current disk with the selected
new disk.

<P>RESET is in the "System" menu.

<H4>Keyboard</H4>

<P>The following keys perform the indicated functions.
Other keys should function as expected. Num Lock (or Shift) is required
for normal Kaypro kaypad use.

<H4>Copy/Paste</H4>

<P>Screen text copy is supported. Click and drag a portion of the screen to
copy the text into your clipboard buffer. Video attributes are lost, and blanks
at the ends of lines are removed. Select highlight disappears after a few seconds,
but the clipboard content is not changed.

<P>Text may be pasted to the computer using the middle mouse button.
Beware that pasted text may easily overrun the computer, depending on
the current CP/M or ROM version and its style of keyboard input.
If the input is interrput driven, or uses a background polling scheme,
then pasted text longer than the buffer length will get lost.
Use a <A HREF="Config.html">configuration file</A>
and specify paste rate/delay values to slow down
the rate at which characters are pasted.
