<H2>Virtual Kaypro Computer</H2>
<IMG SRC="kaypro84-2.png">
<P>A pure-Java implementation using a modified
Java Z80 simulator from https://github.com/jsanchezv/JSpeccy.git.
<P>
My first personal computer was a "Kaypro 2X", although exact model information veries.
The case was labeled "Kaypro 2" and the back nameplate had an "X" sticker next to the "2".
The first motherboard appeared to match what was called "Kaypro 84" in other
circles, and had the 81-292 ROM and ran CP/M 2.2G.
The motherboard later died, and was replaced with a similar model
having the newer "universal" 81-478 ROM and requring CP/M 2.2u.
The following models are currently supported:

<P><UL>
<LI>Kaypro 2X, no RTC, modem, or PIO.
<LI>Kaypro 84, with RTC, modem, and PIO.
<LI><A HREF="kaypro84X.html">Kaypro 84X</A>, a special modification for CP/M 3.
<LI>Kaypro 10, all of model 84 plus WD1002 Winchester disk.
<LI>Kaypro 10X, Model 10 modified for CP/M Plus. (TBD)
</UL>
<P>Note that models 84X and 10X were never actual products.
Model 10X never existed in real hardware.
<P>All of these models seemed to have similar/compatible hardware, 
and are all capable of running with the "universal ROM".
Other models may be developed as virtual hardware is created.
Currently, there are no restrictions on what ROM is used.
The user must ensure the CP/M version is compatible.
<P>Computer is configured using a "properties file", plain text.
The downloads page has some examples in the "configs" subdirectory.
The jar looks for "vkayprorc" in the current directory,
then ".vkayprorc" in the user's home directory.
This may be overridden by specifying the path to a config
file in the environment variable "KAYPRO_CONFIG".
<P>
The virtual computer jar, and source code, is available on this
