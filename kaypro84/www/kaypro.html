<H2>Virtual Kaypro Computer</H2>
<IMG SRC="kaypro84-2.png">
<P>A pure-Java implementation using a modified
Java Z80 simulator from https://github.com/jsanchezv/JSpeccy.git.
<P>
My first personal computer was a "Kaypro 2X", although exact model information veries.
The case was labeled "Kaypro 2" and the back nameplate had an "X" sticker next to the "2".
The first motherboard appeared to match what was called "Kaypro 84" in other
circles, and had the 81-292 ROM and ran CP/M 2.2G.
The motherboard later died, and was replaced with a similar model
having the newer "universal" 81-478 ROM and requring CP/M 2.2u.

<P>Base hardware is currently 2 Z80-SIOs (serial data, keyboard, serial printer, modem),
with two WD1943 Baud generators, WD1793 Floppy Disk Controller, System Port,
Centronics Parallel Printer Port, MC6845-based CRT Controller.
I seem to recall that the built-in modem had problems, and was
probably obsolete soon after release, which may explain why many machines did not
have it.
The following models are currently supported:

<P>Default ROM may be overridden with config property.
<P>Note that models 84X and 10X were never actual products.
Model 10X never existed in real hardware.
<P>All of these models seemed to have similar/compatible hardware, 
and are all capable of running with the "universal ROM".
Other models may be developed as virtual hardware is created.
Currently, there are no restrictions on what ROM is used.
The user must ensure the CP/M version is compatible.

<P>Computer is configured using a "properties file", plain text.
The downloads page has some examples in the "configs" subdirectory.
The jar looks for "vkayprorc" in the current directory,
then ".vkayprorc" in the user's home directory.
This may be overridden by specifying the path to a config
file in the environment variable "KAYPRO_CONFIG".
<P>The display (CRT) is implemented using a TrueType font derived from the
character generator ROM (81-187/81-235). However, the original video
aspect ratio was about 1:1.2 and this cannot be cleanly displayed
using pixel-sized features. The result is a feature aspect ratio of 1:1
which results in a wider/shorter screen than the original hardware.
