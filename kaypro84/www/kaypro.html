<H2>Virtual Kaypro Computer</H2>
<IMG SRC="kaypro84-2.png">
<P>A pure-Java implementation using a modified
Java Z80 simulator from https://github.com/jsanchezv/JSpeccy.git.
<P>
My first personal computer was a "Kaypro 2X", although exact model information veries.
The case was labeled "Kaypro 2" and the back nameplate had an "X" sticker next to the "2".
The first motherboard appeared to match what was called "Kaypro 84" in other
circles, and had the 81-292 ROM and ran CP/M 2.2G.
The motherboard later died, and was replaced with a similar model
having the newer "universal" 81-478 ROM and requring CP/M 2.2u.

<P>Base hardware is currently 2 Z80-SIOs (serial data, keyboard, serial printer, modem),
with two WD1943 Baud generators, WD1793 Floppy Disk Controller, System Port,
Centronics Parallel Printer Port, SY6545-based CRT Controller.
I seem to recall that the built-in modem had problems, and was
probably obsolete soon after release, which may explain why many machines did not
have it.
The following models are currently supported:

</TABLE>
<P>Default ROM may be overridden with config property.
<P>Note that models 84X and 10X were never actual products.
Model 10X never existed in real hardware.
<P>All of these models seemed to have similar/compatible hardware, 
and are all capable of running with the "universal ROM".
Models 2X (2/84) and 4/84 used the same motherboard, with some parts
left out in the case of 2X. Model 10 used a different motherboard
but was generally software compatible. The model 10 was incapable of
hosting a built-in modem.
Other (older) models do not have the same level of compatability,
and may be developed as virtual hardware is created and/or software is available.
Currently, there are no restrictions on what ROM is used.
The user must ensure the CP/M version is compatible.
<P><TABLE BORDER>
<TR><TH>ROM</TH><TH>CP/M Version(s)</TH></TR>

<TR><TD>81-478a</TD><TD>2.2u</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
<P>There are multiple aspects to ROM-CP/M compatability. Some subtle changes
were made over time to the ROM entry points (older CP/M may not make correct ROM calls),
plus the ROMs changed how they interpret the boot loader sector
(e.g. 81-478a requires a checksum on the
boot sector which older boot images do not have).

<P>The Virtual Computer is configured using a "properties file", plain text.
The downloads page has some examples in the "configs" subdirectory.
The jar looks for "vkayprorc" in the current directory,
then ".vkayprorc" in the user's home directory.
This may be overridden by specifying the path to a config
file in the environment variable "KAYPRO_CONFIG"
or as the first commandline argument.
<P>The display (CRT) is implemented using a TrueType font derived from the
character generator ROM (81-187/81-235). However, the original video
dot aspect ratio was about 1:1.2 and this cannot be cleanly displayed
using pixel-sized features. The result is a feature aspect ratio of 1:1
which results in a wider/shorter screen than the original hardware.
<P>
The virtual computer jar, and source code, is available on this
<A HREF="http://sebhc.durgadas.com/kaypro">download page</A>.
Additionally, the utility
<A HREF="http://sebhc.durgadas.com/mms89/format.jar">format.jar</A>
may be used to create Kaypro format floppy disk images for the simulation.
It can be used to pre-load files or TD0 or IMD images also.
