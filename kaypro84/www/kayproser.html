<H2>Kaypro Computer Serial Ports</H2>

<P>Serials ports may be configured to attach to an application
or built-in class. The property has the port mnemonic with "_att"
appended. The mnemonic "data" is for the "Serial Data I/O" port (later models)
or the "Serial I/O" port (early models). The mnemonic "aux" is for
the "Serial Printer" port on later models.
The following built-in classes may be used:

<P><DL>
<DT>ProgramSerial</DT>
<DD>The arguments form a commandline to be executed on the host.
The input of the command is fed from the serial port output,
and the output of the command feeds the serial port input.
</DD>
<DT>Diablo630Serial</DT>
<DD>The output of the serial port is sent to the Diablo630 emulation.
Arguments set the defaults for the emulation, which includes "conf=file"
where "file" may specify the same config file as used for VirtualKaypro.
See <A HREF="http://mms89.durgadas.com/mms89diablo.html">Diable630 properties</A>.
</DD>
<DT>TelnetSerial</DT>
<DD>This emulates a serial-to-ethernet module. Arguments specify the
host and port number on which to listen for connections.
Optional third argument is the keyword "modem" which directs
TelnetSerial to use the modem controls to control whether the program
runs, and indicate if it is running.
</DD>
<DT>TtySerial</DT>
<DD>This connects the simulation serial port to an actual serial port
(tty) on the host. The arguments are "tty=dev,baud" and "modem".
The "dev" should be the correct string for the host to resolve to
a specific serial port.
"baud" defaults to 9600, but must match the virtual serial
port setting.
The optional "modem" flag causes this class to pass along modem control
changes between the virtual serial port and the real host serial port.

<P>Use of this class requires that the simulation be started with
jSerial JAR included. This typically requires a command of the form:
<P><UL>
java -cp VirtualKaypro.jar:jSerialComm-X.Y.X.jar VirtualKaypro args...
</UL>
<P>See <A HREF="https://fazecast.github.io/jSerialComm/">
