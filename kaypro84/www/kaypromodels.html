<H2>Kaypro Computer Models</H2>

<P>Base virtual hardware is currently 2 Z80-SIOs
(serial data, keyboard, serial printer, modem),
with two WD1943 Baud generators, WD1793 Floppy Disk Controller, System Port,
Centronics Parallel Printer Port, SY6545-based CRT Controller.

<P>Default ROM may be overridden with config property.

<P>Kaypro did not seem to have a strict relationship between advertised,
or designated, models and specific hardware. The mainboard, and ROM,
that was shipped under a givel model "label" varied over time.

<P>All of these models seemed to have similar/compatible hardware, 
and are all capable of running with the "universal ROM".
Models 2X (2/84) and 4/84 used the same mainboard, with some parts
left out in the case of 2X. Model 10 used a different mainboard
but was generally software compatible. The early model 10 was incapable of
hosting a built-in modem.
Other (older) models (specifically, models 2/II and 4)
do not have the same level of compatability,
and may be developed as virtual hardware is created and/or software is available.
Currently, there are no restrictions on what ROM is used, since earlier models
are not supported.
The user must ensure the CP/M version is compatible.

<P>There are multiple aspects to ROM-CP/M compatability. Some subtle changes
were made over time to the ROM entry points (older CP/M may not make correct ROM calls),
plus the ROMs changed how they interpret the boot loader sector
(e.g. 81-478a requires a checksum on the
boot sector which older boot images do not have).

<P>CP/M 2.20d was a special version I derived from 2.2G, I think mainly to use
as a loader for CP/M 3. I need to look through the source code to see what
my reasons were for making that.

<P>The above matrix is based on "Kaypro Technical Manual 1484-F
and a trivial boot test and "DIR". The manual also describes these model
features:

</TABLE>
<P>* One serial port for Keyboard; if 4 total then one dedicated to Modem
(regardless of whether installed). Modem and RTC use a Z80-PIO which is otherwise
not installed.
<P>** One serial port for Keyboard, one unused/unavailable.
<P>QD = hi-density 160-track drives, DD = standard 40-track drives.
<P>Models 2 and 4 use Z80-PIOs for Centr and system port. Half of each is unused.
<P>Models shown with yellow background are not supported by the Virtual Kaypro.

<P>There seemed to be a lot of variation in model designations, and
later production of early models seemed to use newer, different, boards.
There seemed to be
an effort to converge the entire 8-bit product line into a single mainboard
design, and schematics show a later design that would work in all models
and require only a jumper to select between standard and high-density floppies,
along with optionally populating modem/rtc and/or winchester interface sections.
Theoretically, case designs had to change as well, for example early model 10s
(or model 2) had a different backside connector arrangement.
