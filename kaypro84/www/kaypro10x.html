<H2>Virtual Kaypro 10X Computer</H2>

<IMG SRC="kaypro10X-1.png">

<P>A fictitious, yet possible, modified Kaypro 10
with 256K RAM and an RTC to run CP/M 3. I similarly modified
a Kaypro 2X back in 1986 to add 256K memory.
The RTC modification to a Kaypro 10 would have been a bit more
tricky, as the Kaypro 10 motherboard did not contain the circuitry.
However, it is theoretically possible that the Kaypro 2X and 2/84
motherboard would have worked in a Kaypro 10, as both contain the
winchester disk interface. Getting the back panel cut-outs to line up
would have been more work.

<P>Look for disk image "WD1002-0.cpm3" (rename/copy to "WD1002-0" for use)
on the <A HREF="http://sebhc.durgadas.com/kaypro">downloads</A>
page, along with config file "kaypro10x".

<P>CP/NET is also working for CP/M 3. Use disk image "WD1002-0.cpnet3"
and config "kaypro10x.cpnet" (example). Allows access to host files
as placed in ~/HostFileBdos/* subdirectories ("*" is "a" thru "p").
Watch for line-endings, Linux uses only line-feed. The program "TR"
may be used to copy file and translate line endings.

<P><UL>
<LI>TR A:=P:*.*[C] to translate Unix to CP/M
<LI>TR P:=A:*.*[U] to translate CP/M to Unix
</UL>

<P>To start CP/NET, run the NDOS3 RSX with command "NDOS3". To remove
CP/NET use "RSXRM NDOS3".
